When the 29 year old subingtian became the first Chinese athlete to win the men's sprint medal in the world competition, his struggle must be happy... 
Life is endless, struggle is endless, chasing and wearing armor in constant learning and constant innovation, and making the journey no longer difficult in training his skills.
Integrate personal dreams into the feelings of home and country, and achieve their own wonderful life.
Happiness in struggle is the sublimation of youth supporting the "backbone" in dedication.
