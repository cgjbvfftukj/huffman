Struggle is the working background of youth and the spiritual anchor. 
Every generation has its youth. No generation has a smooth road to youth.
The background of youth can never be separated from the word "struggle".
As a young man in the new era, he should strive hard, show the lofty ambition of "success does not have to be in me, success must have me", and write the chapter of life with struggle.
Happiness in struggle is the persistence of youth in ideals and beliefs. 
Struggle is colorful because of lofty ideals, and life is shining because of ideals and beliefs.
April showers bring May flowers. Because of his ideal and belief of "studying for the rise of China", Zhou Enlai devoted his life to writing the history of China's independence and self-reliance with struggle; Because he had the ideal and belief of "let socialism be carried forward in China", Deng Xiaoping kept his original heart in mind and wrote the history of China's prosperity with struggle;
The happiness in the struggle is the brilliance of the youth in the struggle.
There is sunshine in your heart and strength under your feet.
When the 23-year-old Huan Xiang went to the Syrian battlefield and risked his life to complete the task of news reporting in the gunfire, his struggle must be happy;
When 24-year-old Wu Dajing won the men's 500m short track speed skating champion in the Pingchang Winter Olympics, his struggle must be happy;
When the 29 year old subingtian became the first Chinese athlete to win the men's sprint medal in the world competition, his struggle must be happy... 
Life is endless, struggle is endless, chasing and wearing armor in constant learning and constant innovation, and making the journey no longer difficult in training his skills.
Integrate personal dreams into the feelings of home and country, and achieve their own wonderful life.
Happiness in struggle is the sublimation of youth supporting the "backbone" in dedication.
In youth, if you choose to bear hardships, you will choose to reap; if you choose to contribute, you will choose to be noble. 
At the critical moment of flood fighting and rescue in Henan, a group of young people's soldiers issued clank vows, sounded the call of youth rally, and rushed to the front line. 
People are relocated, levees and crevasses are blocked, accumulated water and waterlogging are cleared, sandbags are carried, river courses are patrolled, piping is checked... The "white feet", "more than a hundred blisters" and "the most beautiful sleeping position".
The "mark" of youth on the levee is moving. When the COVID-19 suddenly came in early 2020, the generation once considered as jiaodidi resolutely turned around and put on their war robes, and bravely went retrograde to the front line of anti epidemic. In the fight against the COVID-19, groups of young volunteers fought day and night in hospitals, schools, residential areas, transportation hubs, nucleic acid sampling points, etc., carrying out diversion, order maintenance, information registration and helping to solve emergency problems, so as to contribute to the protection of cities.

Today, young people of the new era, with the historical mission of building the the Belt and Road and building a community of shared future for mankind, have already had full confidence in their hearts to participate in outlining and shaping the future of the whole world.
China's thinking, China's plan and China's action are following the footsteps of Chinese youth all over the world and setting off waves in more and more parts of the world. A beautiful dream must be realized through struggle; The brilliance of life can only be achieved through struggle. Only when the young generation shoulder the mission and work hard can they confidently shout out: "please rest assured that there is me in a strong country!"
